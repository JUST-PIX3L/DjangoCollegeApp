I will try to keep the series releasing on a fortnightly basis so that people can keep interest without feeling to bombarded with information.
The proposed chapters for the project can be seen below with the intention being that a snapshot will be taken at each chapter with it's own branchto make tracking code easier.
* Chapter 1 - Django Setup and Basic WebApp
* Chapter 2 - Project Overview and HTML Setup
* Chapter 3 - Creating our Django Models
* Chapter 4 - Django Admin View
* Chapter 5 - Render Model Data on HTML Page + Basic CSS
* Chapter 6 - Adding new Pages with Templates
* Chatper 7 - Improving our View Code
* Chapter 8 - Using Datatables 
* Chapter 9 - Django Unit Testing
* Chapter 10 - Using Flake8 to check Python Code Formatting

One final thing I am not a Developer by any means I am a Testing Consultant with some knowledge of basic Development, so while you might be following this series to learn so am I. I would just like to take people along this journey with me. If there are other topic that are of interest to you then please do reach out and let me know we may be able to incorporate that in future training sessions.
